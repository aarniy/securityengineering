Task 1

In the video the example in medical equipment was infusion pumps. The problem with them was that pumps vendors did not have enough strict standards for the pump user interface. Only some colours were standardized which lead to  buttons increasing or lowering the amount in the vendors hands. This lead to confusion and user error that eventually killed patients. This was not immediately noticed since infusion pump is needed in many cases where the patient is in the verge of death. Also some pumps were able to be attacked via Wi-Fi. This was something that forced changes in standardization. Biden also made some changes in the FDA and in EU since 2021 there is post-market surveillance. In the car world the safety concerns were for a long autopiloted vehicles. Which started getting noticed in 1982 when Israel fought Syria. Israel sent remotely autopiloted vehicles to detect Syrias air defense then take it down with other ways. In the civilian field google started developing autopiloted cars in 2009 and eventually Tesla released its first car in 2014 which had autipilot. The autopilot risk was not and probably still is not closely enough monitored since it can turn off before accident and then the fault would be claimed by the driver. Tesla even falsely claimed that their autopiloted vehicles had fewer fatal accidents than normal cars. This leads to the last point of neglected safety concerns which was Volkswagen who claimed that their emissions were lower than they were in reality. Example of change was in 2015 when Jeep Cherokee was able to be hacked over the mobile network where the car was. This made into news and lead to Chrysler recalling 1.4 million cars costing over 1 billion dollars.
